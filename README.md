# minis
A collection of small projects.

I thought it might be better to place these tiny projects I do for fun or for practice in a single repository. 

So far, I have: <br>
-a tic tac toe game <br>
-a basic calculator app <br>
-a webpage that tells you the weather on the north pole <br>
-a JS pong game (in progress) <br>
-???? <br>
-profit(???)<br>

Thanks for checking it out â˜†
