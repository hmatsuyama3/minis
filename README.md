# minis
A collection of small projects.

I thought it might be better to place these tiny projects I do for fun or for practice in a single repository. 

So far, I have: <br>
-a tic tac toe game (Java) <br>
-a basic calculator app (Java) <br>
-a webpage that tells you the "weather" on the north pole<br>
-a pong game (still a bit buggy) (JS) <br>
-a simple whack-a-mole game (JS) <br>
-???? <br>
-profit(???)<br>

Thanks for checking it out â˜†
